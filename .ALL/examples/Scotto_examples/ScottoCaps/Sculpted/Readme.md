# ScottoCaps (Sculpted)

Sculpted Cherry MX keycaps designed for FDM 3D printing. I recommend putting the back of the keycap towards the build plate. By doing this, you'll hide any texture on the back of the cap where it won't be as visible.

# Stems

The stems are designed based on a tolerance of ~0.15mm, your printer may or may not be capable of handling this. If your keycaps are too tight, you can use some hot water to make the plastic more pliable when installing them. If they are too loose, you can cut [Kapton tape](https://amzn.to/45GeFFr) and use it between the keycap and switch to improve the fit.

This same method will apply to the stabilizers and is more likely to be needed as they're not all made equal. I've found some stabilizers are a lot smaller than the Cherry MX stem specifications which in turn requires more than one piece of tape to get them properly attached.

**Don't force them onto your switches as if they're too tight, it will be very hard to get them off.**
